Then in the root of this project, type `box install`.  This will download the necessary dependencies to develop and test the core.  You can then go ahead and start an embedded server `box server start` and start hacking around.  For running our test suites you will need 2 more steps, so please refer to the [Readme](tests/readme.md) in the tests folder.--- ###THE DAILY BREAD > "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me (JESUS)" Jn 14:1-12
